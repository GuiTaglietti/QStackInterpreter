# QStackInterpreter

The Stack Interpreter project is an initiative designed to simulate the Harvard architecture with a focus on stack-based operations. In this project, the fundamental computing model follows the principles of the Harvard architecture, where distinct memory spaces are dedicated to program instructions and data. Specifically, a stack-based approach is adopted, emphasizing the use of a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure to manage computational tasks. One of the key features of the Stack Interpreter is its ability to export the operations performed on the stack to both C++ and assembly files.This functionality facilitates a seamless transition from the high-level representation of the stack operations to the corresponding low-level implementations in both C++ and assembly languages. This dual-export capability enhances the project's versatility, allowing users to analyze and further develop their stack-based algorithms in different programming environments. By providing a simulation environment for the Harvard architecture, the Stack Interpreter project serves as a valuable tool for both educational and practical purposes. It enables users to explore the intricacies of stack-based computing, understand the underlying principles of the Harvard architecture, and experiment with diverse algorithms and data structures.

Special thanks to everyone who passed here to take a look and support the project!

## Tools used for development
* Main language: C++ (Advanced OOP paradigm)
* Framework: QTCreator
* OS: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
## Running/Usage demonstration

## Installation

Currently, to run the application, you will need at least QT6 and a Linux environment (Deploy will come soon...)

1 - Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone <repolink>
```

2 - Launch QTCreator and open the project, build and run
    
OBS: Deploy and better way to install the application will come as soon as possible!
